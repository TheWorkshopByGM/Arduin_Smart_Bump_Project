# Arduin_Smart_Bump_Project
If you are interested in replicating my project, you will need to 3D print the files in the 3D designs folder. The supports for the 9G and SG996 servos are provided too!

After assembling the circuit (coming soon) you only need to upload the arduino codes to the arduinos unos and megas respectivaly.

I hope you found this project interesting, If you face any problem or need additional information watch my youtube video at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnRzkZ6FY14 If you still need help, you can leave me a comment in the comment section of the video.
